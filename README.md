# Mastermind-Game
This is a game I made based off the board game Mastermind where the computer randomly generates four numbers and the user has 10 attempts to guess the four numbers in the order the computer has generated them in

KEY:
W = The user has guessed the correct number in the correct spot
* = The user has guessed the correct number, but in the wrong place
X = The user has guessed the wrong number

The symbols used within the key can be changed when the second option from the main menu is selected
